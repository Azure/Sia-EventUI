    Action could be:
        an object
        a function that takes dispatch as an argument (thunk middleware action)
    If the action is a function, call it passing in dispatch.
    If the action is an object record it; a single action sets the .action property,
        a second action turns .action into an array.
        Subsequent actions are added to the array.
